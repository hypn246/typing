**NOTE:** The formula using in this project isn't completely correct. In the second mode, the result is always wrong about 7-19% with the reality. IDK why but at least I have something to give my GUI subject leturer.

*Update:* In 17th April 2025, I have submited this project as a mid-semester work and I got a 10. Yeah!!
